The place to start looking is index.njk and index.11tydata.js. The index.njk file is a Nunjucks template for the root HTML file, powered by the data from index.11tydata.js. Next, you can take a look at main.scss, which defines the entire styling for the page. It's written in Sass, which extends CSS with some nice features like variables and mixins.

            <p>Hello! My name is Intae (pronounced IN-teh) and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I've been advised by <a href="http://gusevlab.org/">Professor Alexander Gusev</a> at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School and <a href="https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/">Professor Marzyeh Ghassemi</a> at CSAIL, MIT. Before starting my current PhD thesis work, I was advised by Professor David Perreault at MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) and worked on electrical energy conversion and control for my master's thesis. I received B.S. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.</p>

            <p>My PhD research involves developing machine learning based approaches at the intersection of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and genomics data for improving clinical management of patients with cancer. I'm interested in demystifying disease mechanisms as well as prognosis, and ultimately improving clinical decision making.</p>

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>In Spring 2022, I taught <a href="https://mlhcmit.github.io/">6.871 : Machine Learning for Healthcare</a> at MIT as a teaching assistant. I held a weekly recitation session, mentored students' class projects, and developed problem sets.</li> 
    <li>In Spring 2019, I was a TA for 6.004 : Computation Structures at MIT. I helped design and build new laboratory assignments and course materials in a RISC-V assembly and hardware description language called Bluespec.</li>
