            <p>Hello! My name is Intae (pronounced IN-teh) and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I've been advised by <a href="http://gusevlab.org/">Professor Alexander Gusev</a> at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School and <a href="https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/">Professor Marzyeh Ghassemi</a> at CSAIL, MIT. Before starting my current PhD thesis work, I was advised by Professor David Perreault at MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) and worked on electrical energy conversion and control for my master's thesis. I received B.S. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.</p>

            <p>At the intersection of medicine and AI, my research is focused on harnessing the depth of clinical data to develop evidence-based decision support tools in medicine, while mitigating potential harms from biased AI algorithms.</p>

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>In Spring 2022, I taught <a href="https://mlhcmit.github.io/2022/index.html">6.871 : Machine Learning for Healthcare</a> at MIT as a teaching assistant. I created weekly recitation content and developed Python-based problem sets, in order to improve students' understanding of real-world healthcare applications of machine learning. I also coordinated collaborations between clinical researchers from MIT and Harvard, and students for course projects, and provided mentorship on student projects, leading to notable publications. I received the Carlton E. Tucker Award for Teaching Excellence (overall instructor rating: 6.8/7.0).</li> 
    <li>In Spring 2019, I was a TA for 6.004 : Computation Structures at MIT. I helped design and build new laboratory assignments and course materials in a RISC-V assembly and hardware description language called Bluespec.</li>
