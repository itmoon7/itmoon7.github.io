The place to start looking is index.njk and index.11tydata.js. The index.njk file is a Nunjucks template for the root HTML file, powered by the data from index.11tydata.js. Next, you can take a look at main.scss, which defines the entire styling for the page. It's written in Sass, which extends CSS with some nice features like variables and mixins.

            <p>Hello! My name is Intae (pronounced IN-teh) and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I've been advised by <a href="http://gusevlab.org/">Professor Alexander Gusev</a> at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School and <a href="https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/">Professor Marzyeh Ghassemi</a> at CSAIL, MIT. Before starting my current PhD thesis work, I was advised by Professor David Perreault at MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) and worked on electrical energy conversion and control for my master's thesis. I received B.S. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.</p>

            <p>I'm interested in improving <i>deployability</i> of machine learning models by making them robust to real-world data issues such as missing data, heterogeneity, and dataset shifts in critical decision-making settings like healthcare. In terms of practical applications, my research involves developing machine learning-based approaches at the intersection of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and genomics data for improving clinical management of patients with cancer.</p>

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>In Spring 2022, I taught <a href="https://mlhcmit.github.io/2022/index.html">6.871 : Machine Learning for Healthcare</a> at MIT as a teaching assistant. I held a weekly recitation session, mentored students' class projects, and developed problem sets.</li> 
    <li>In Spring 2019, I was a TA for 6.004 : Computation Structures at MIT. I helped design and build new laboratory assignments and course materials in a RISC-V assembly and hardware description language called Bluespec.</li>
