The place to start looking is index.njk and index.11tydata.js. The index.njk file is a Nunjucks template for the root HTML file, powered by the data from index.11tydata.js. Next, you can take a look at main.scss, which defines the entire styling for the page. It's written in Sass, which extends CSS with some nice features like variables and mixins.

            <p>Hello! My name is Intae and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Since Fall 2019, I have been advised by <a href="http://gusevlab.org/">Professor Alexander Gusev</a> at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. Before starting my current PhD thesis work, I was advised by Professor David Perreault at MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) and worked on electrical energy conversion and control for my master's thesis.</p>

            <p>My PhD research involves developing machine learning based approaches at the intersection of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and genomics data for improving clinical management of patients with cancer. I'm interested in demystifying disease mechanisms as well as prognosis, and ultimately improving clinical decision making.</p>

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    In Spring 2022, I'm currently teaching <a href="https://mlhcmit.github.io/">6.871 : Machine Learning for Healthcare</a> at MIT as a teaching assistant. I hold a weekly recitation session, mentor students' class projects, and develop problem sets. In Spring 2019, I was a TA for 6.004 : Computation Structures at MIT. I helped design and build new laboratory assignments and course materials in a RISC-V assembly and hardware description language called Bluespec.
